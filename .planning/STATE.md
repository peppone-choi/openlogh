# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** Every game mechanic must produce identical outcomes to the legacy PHP implementation given the same inputs.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — deterministic-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (deterministic-foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-03-31

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Fine granularity (11 phases) -- battle system split into framework + completion; economy separated from commands
- [Roadmap]: Strict dependency ordering -- foundation before types before systems before composites
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (Modifiers) depends on Phase 3 (not Phase 4) -- modifier pipeline needed for domestic commands, not remaining battle triggers
- [Phase 01]: RandUtil.choice() single-element guard uses rng.nextLegacyInt(1L) for PHP array_rand parity
- [Phase 01]: buildPreTurnTriggers() rng parameter has no default -- callers must explicitly inject RNG

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged Phase 3 (Battle) and Phase 8 (NPC AI) as needing deeper legacy-core/ reference reading during planning
- jqwik-kotlin 1.9.3 compatibility with Kotlin 2.1 needs smoke test verification (Phase 2 tooling)
